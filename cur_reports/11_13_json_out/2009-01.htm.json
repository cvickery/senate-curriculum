To achieve this level of knowledge and understanding, a multidisciplinary approach to studying Earth as a system is needed. It involves studying the processes and interactions among the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and lithosphere from global to local scale, and across time spans of minutes to eons. It requires the use of physical and chemical laws with mathematics to describe the physical, chemical and biological processes within each sphere and the interactions between the spheres. These descriptions are used along with observations from ground, airborne, waterborne, and spaceborne instruments to construct models through which complex interactions of the spheres are studied. It is through the understanding of these complex interactions that accurate, predictive models are developed.\nIn building on the traditional disciplines to study the Earth, the system approach has become widely accepted as a framework from which to pose disciplinary and interdisciplinary questions in relationship to humankind. While this system view is elegant, the pedagogical challenge to educators attempting to quantify the breadth of the system’s elements, states and processes within the classroom is enormous. Therefore, we focus our proposed earth system science course with an objective of constructing an overarching interdisciplinary framework to understand the past, present and future of the earth’s climate, especially the carbon cycle. We seek to provide the necessary depth and breadth needed to serve as a foundation for advanced study among majors, and lay the foundations for sustainability and informed stewardship in striving for an Earth-aware and Climate change-informed society.","title":"CHEM 113","approval_date":"10/02/08","id":"7","description":"A historical perspective of processes and interactions among the lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere with humans as a force for change; knowledge of how the Earth system responds to changes in these forcings to mitigate the predicted effects for human civilization.","disp":"School of Earth and Environmental Sciences"},{"course_num":"370","department":"GEOL","approval_date":"10/02/08","description":"4 and CHEM 113.1","prereq":"GEOL 101 and CHEM 113","justification":"The course covers the same topics as the GEOL 270.
