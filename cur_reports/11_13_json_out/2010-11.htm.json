Given that over sixty-five percent of all feature films produced today begin with screenplays based upon source materials, this writing-intensive course provides students with applied knowledge about how to use various source materials including novels, true stories, newspaper stories, short stories, and other forms for the screen to create an original screenplay. Students will engage in different kinds of writing from free writing to a formal screenplay, written in stages, with revision incorporated into the process. This course clearly meets the minimal requirements for a writing-intensive course with students engaging in revision, group critique, and writing more than 30 pages over the course of the semester. It is an elective.","text":"AIV. 1. Media Studies (10-23, approved by Academic Senate 9/16/10)\nMEDST 246. Art of the Adaptation\n3 hours, 3 credits.
