Students will administer and interpret an informal reading inventory and examine environmental and instructional factors that influence reading and writing achievement. Students will also examine reading levels, formative evaluation strategies, motivational influences, strategies for teaching word recognition and comprehension, grouping strategies, and strategy instruction.\nJustification: This course is an extension of the ECPSE 700 and 710. Both courses introduce graduate students to the reading and writing problems of students at risk for special education referral and the reading and writing problems of students with learning disabilities, emotional disorders, mental retardation, and communication disorders. In comparison to ECPSE 700 and 710, this course will provide a more in-depth study of how to remediate reading and writing problems. It is essential that special education teachers know how to remediate such problems as they are often the only professionals available to help students with these problems.\nThis course will replace of ECPSE 711(Curriculum Adaptations and Teaching Strategies for Childhood Special Education).
