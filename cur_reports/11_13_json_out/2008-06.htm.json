Such a course might be based on a text such as those published by Cambridge University Press in their Cambridge Language Series (e.g. The Languages of Japan, Korean, Chinese, The Indo-Aryan Languages, etc.). Because ability in the language is not a prerequisite, the course is open to students with goals other than fluency. Such a course might appeal to (i) students who see language as an object of study (e.g. students of linguistics with an interest in structure rather than in the ability to converse), (ii) students of the language looking for an overall picture of how the grammar of a language is organized, (iii) speakers of one language with an interest in how a related language compares, (iv) students with a general interest in a language who are considering more extensive study. For the same reason, the level of analysis between a version of this course on Mandarin and the newly described Chinese 217-218 (which are really for the specialist in Chinese) would be very different. Obviously, the languages which might be discussed in this class would be greater in number than those for which we have lengthy programs of instruction. The parenthetical “or language family” allows the possibility of a course on a language family such as Altaic which would include not only Japanese and Korean but languages such as Turkish and Mongolian as well. Based on the knowledge and interests of our current staff, we could begin immediately offering such courses on Mandarin, Cantonese, Korean, Japanese, Tibetan. The restriction on repeating the course prevents a student from studying, in different semesters, pairs such as Mandarin and Cantonese (Sinitic) or Japanese and Korean (Altaic). Likewise, were we to offer a course on Altaic, neither Japanese nor Korean could be studied later.","id":"20","title":"VT","disp":"Classical, Middle Eastern &amp; Asian Languages &amp; Cultures"}]
