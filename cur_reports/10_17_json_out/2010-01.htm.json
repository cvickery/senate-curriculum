As part of that major, the department is committed to creating a number of courses where Chinese is the language of instruction but not the topic of study, i.e. content courses which are taught in Chinese. Three outside observers have noted the absence of such courses and commented on their appropriateness for our student body. More importantly, the new major in Chinese is designed to satisfy the content requirement New York State Initial Teaching Certification in Chinese. Content courses such as that proposed here are required by the State, and the course described here is in fact the last class that must be added to meet the minimum State requirements.
