Professional standards in the discipline of special education from the Council for Exceptional Children and from the New York State Education Department identify assessment as a critical knowledge area for special education teachers. All special education teachers must be able to interpret and use both formal and informal assessment information to guide instruction and to establish long-term goals and short-term objectives for students’ Individualized Education Programs (IEPs).","title":"Introduction to Assessment in Special Education","description":"The purpose of this course is to prepare special education teachers across all age-range certifications to engage in reflective decision-making and research-validated professional practice that will result in the creation of effective instructional programs for all students, including those students who are classified for special education services and supports with mild, moderate and severe disabilities. The emphasis is on familiarizing candidates with a wide range of assessment approaches and instruments, providing them with knowledge, skills, and dispositions associated with the application of assessment information to individual student and program evaluation, as well as to classroom and curriculum planning."}]
