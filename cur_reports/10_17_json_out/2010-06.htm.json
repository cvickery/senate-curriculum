Prereq. or coreq.:  CHEM 212 or 378 and permission of the instructor.  \nAn introduction, using a project-based approach, to standard techniques and experiments in physical and biophysical chemistry.  Chemical modeling and advanced data analysis are also covered.  Written reports and presentations are required.  Field trips may be taken that will require a field trip fee.  Spring.\nJustification: The Department is currently in the process of changing the curriculum to account for the new ACS guidelines.  These guidelines require students to have 400 laboratory hours in four of the five foundation areas (i.e., organic, inorganic, analytical, physical, and biochemistry).  The department has changed the physical chemistry laboratory (CHEM 316W) into a combined physical and biophysical chemistry laboratory course.  The original biophysical chemistry laboratory (CHEM 378) is being removed.  The changes in prerequisite and corequisites account for the combination of CHEM 316W and 378.  The permission of the instructor is required to allow the instructor to register students at Brookhaven National Laboratory during the registration process.  The description has been changed to indicate the changes made to the laboratory.  Because this is an advanced project based laboratory and because the ACS requires that all students within a chemistry program must have 400 laboratory hours (excluding introductory chemistry laboratory), one recitation hour and four hours of laboratory work are required for this two credit hour course.\nJustification: This new course serves as the capstone for students majoring in Finance.","justification":"This new course serves as the capstone for students majoring in Finance.","id":"23","title":"Advanced Physical and Biophysical Chemistry Laboratory","disp":"Chemistry"},{"course_num":"391","hours":"3","credits":"3","approval_date":"3/11/10","description":"Contrast of the forms of Irish memory from Ireland, Northern Ireland, Britain, and America.

Students will become acquainted with literature and religion as they reflected and shaped historical developments and will also come to engage critically with the past through close readings of primary sources and other documents.\nJustification: This course explores the underlying connections and interplay between politics, religion and literature in early modern England and Ireland. Documents to be read include literary, political texts, ranging from puritan pamphlets, histories of Ireland, Bardic poetry, Milton’s political and literary works, and the treatises of Hobbes and other theorists. Embedded in these texts are the religious and political ideologies that together define the conflicting cultural values of the societies under examination. The inclusion of Ireland (and when possible, Scotland) reflects the relatively recent comparative emphasis on the “Three Kingdoms” (England, Ireland, Scotland) and “New British History” approach that turns away from limited nationalist historical perspectives to encompass a more inclusive and accurate understanding of  the interconnections among these regions. The early modern period was arguably the most turbulent and important century in Britain and Ireland’s history since it is the crucible for the development of the political and economic and religious differences that were to dominate the area’s history from the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries. As such the close source study, comparative approach, and analysis of ideology in this course make it crucial for Irish Studies and an important contribution to the offerings in European studies within the History Department.
