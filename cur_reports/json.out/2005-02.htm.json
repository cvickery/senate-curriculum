Physics 220W may not be used as an elective in the Physics major.\nJustification: The Physics Department wishes to have a course for our majors (and other interested technical majors) that addresses the following needs:\nStudents in the sciences need practice in technical, PowerPoint-based, oral presentations;\nThese same students need practice in library skills, such as use of the Science Citation Index and Physics Abstracts;\nThey also need the opportunity to study, in depth, a technical topic of particular interest to them.\nFinally, they need an opportunity to discuss issues relating to ethics in the sciences, and to career advancement.\nWhile these needs are obvious, they are seldom adequately addressed in standard physics programs, owing to the need to cover much technical material.  The proposed course therefore fills a gap in our physics curriculum. We expect healthy enrollment in this course, since it will satisfy part of the writing intensive requirement for graduation.","id":"3","title":"Current Issues in Physics","disp":"Physics"},{"course_num":"214","hours":"2","department":"FNES","credits":"1","approval_date":"12/9/04","description":"Performance, teaching and assessment of the various net/wall and target activities (e.g., badminton, handball, bowling, golf).
