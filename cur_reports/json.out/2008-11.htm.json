Emphasis is on the creative aspects of moviemaking such as storytelling, character development, abstract visual imagery, documentation, etc., using simple software and inexpensive equipment.\nJustification: We had expected that as digital technology developed and filtered down to secondary education we would be able to cover evolving technology such as digital moviemaking in our Desktop Publishing course (ARTS 191). Instead basic desktop publishing software has become more complex and teaching this takes up more class time than was previously the case. In addition, students wishing to take the minor in digital graphics are increasingly less interested in what used to be the center of that field (Photoshop and Illustrator), which was covered at the elementary level in ARTS 191, and more interested in video and the electronic publishing on the web, for which this class is an introduction.\nStudents will work in teams and we expect to be able to run this course with minimal equipment. We have received a Tech Fee grant to cover the cost of a few camcorders. We expect also that some students will have their own camcorders, or simple $100 camcorders like Pure Digital’s FLIP, or use digital still cameras in movie mode, or even work with cell phones.\nThe emphasis in the class, as the course description makes clear, is not movie production, and finished looking films are not our goal. We want students to have access to simple video technology so they can learn to tell visual stories – to learn narrative and character development – areas of interest to artists and designers that are not currently covered by our curriculum. This course has been developed in collaboration with Dr. Charles Martin of the Comparative Literature Department.\nThe computer labs already have the necessary software (iMovieHD, Final Cut Pro).\nAnticipated enrollment: 20 students (one section)\nFrequency: each semester","justification":"We had expected that as digital technology developed and filtered down to secondary education we would be able to cover evolving technology such as digital moviemaking in our Desktop Publishing course (ARTS 191).

Emphasis is on the creative aspects of using a digital still camera such as subject matter, point of view, natural and artificial light, etc., using a DSLR or other digital equipment and basic image processing software.\nJustification: We had expected that eventually we would be able to cover digital photography as part of our Desktop Publishing course (ARTS 191). The opposite has happened: Basic desktop publishing software has become more complex. Digital cameras have become commonplace and their technology has evolved into something that can justify a separate course. In this new class the emphasis will be on shooting and editing pictures. Students will produce slide shows, albums, or prints for presentation.\nThe department has never been able to offer courses in color photography. With digital cameras, students can make color prints by going to labs in the New York area. For example, some local art schools let their students e-mail digital files to Adorama, a camera store where a 16 x 20 inch color print costs just four dollars.\nWe have applied for and received a Tech Fee grant to buy for a digital color printer. It should be on-line by next semester.\nAnticipated enrollment: 35-40 students (two sections)\nFrequency: each semester.","id":"2","title":"etc","disp":"Studio Art"},{"course_num":"193","hours":"4","department":"ARTS","credits":"3","approval_date":"9/11/08","description":"Introduction to animation using an industry-standard program such as Toom Boom Studio.
