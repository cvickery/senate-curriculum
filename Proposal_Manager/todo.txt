* Notes, in addition to catch-all:
                   cross-listed with (course_id)
                   required/optional part of ____ major/minor

* Course management/oversight
* Gathering assessment materials.
* Course will be offered spring/fall only (put in catalog description?)
* Course structure: lecture/recitation: size and number of sections of each.

* move_syllabi exits with error code 1 every ten seconds. Should not clutter log file when
  there is no work to do; is it still working? It is. Check reason for exit code, though.

* Handle paired W and non-W courses. Enter base course number and get both.
    ENGL 165 => ENGL 165/165W
  whereas
    ENGL 165W => ENGL 165W
  (Check regex for course_number)

  Decision: Tell them if they enter base number, the W version will automatically be
  approved too. But if they enter the W version, the non-W version will not be included.
